'''Unsupervised machine learning''' is the [[machine learning]] task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithm—which is one way of distinguishing unsupervised learning from [[supervised learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]].

A central case of unsupervised learning is the problem of [[density estimation]] in [[statistics]],<ref name="JordanBishop2004">{{cite book |first1=Michael I. |last1=Jordan |first2=Christopher M. |last2=Bishop |chapter=Neural Networks |editor=Allen B.
