Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning] task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithmâ€”which is one way of distinguishing unsupervised learning from supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

A central case of unsupervised learning is the problem of density estimation in statistics, though unsupervised learning encompasses many other problems (and solutions) involving summarizing and explaining key features of the data.
