# Netlify

Netlify makes deploying static sites easy and fast. All you need to do is link a repository to your Netifly account, and every time you git push, Netlift will pull the site to their server, run your build script and deploy the rendered static site on their CDN. It's free to start, and scales nicely.

This theme intends to make Netifly integration easy and fast. It is a work in progress.
