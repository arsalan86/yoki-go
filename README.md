A clean, minimal, neflify ready theme for Hugo, derived from hucore

This is currently a work in progress. I've pushed it in order to be able to deploy to Netlify. Netlify integration is one of my main goals for this theme.

The master branch is being continuously deployed [here](https://yoki-go.netlify.com/)
