# yoki-go (よき-go)

A clean, minimal, netlify ready theme for Hugo, derived from [hucore](https://github.com/mgjohansen/hucore).

This is a work in progress. Netlify integration is one of my main goals for this theme. The master branch (currently locked to #0ed1718) is deployed [here](https://yoki-go.netlify.com/).

Visually, the theme is nearly identical to [hucore](https://github.com/mgjohansen/hucore) with a few layout and font changes. I've derived from hucore (as opposed to forking it) because it is a nice clean theme that serves my purpose well: I wanted a starting point for my experimentations with Hugo and continious deployments on Netlify. This theme is a small part of a larger project I'm working on that incorporates Hugo and the Netlify API. There are no plans for any significant deviations from hucore/Hemingway in terms of style. 

## Installation

Navigate to the root of your Hugo site and add yoki-go as a submodule into the themes folder:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/arsalan86/yoki-go themes/yoki-go
```

The exampleSite folder contains example content used in the live preview, as well as the `config.toml` file. Copy the `config.toml` file to the root of your hugo site, overwriting the existing one if necessary. You may copy the example content from the content folder if you wish.

## Configuration

Configuration is straightforward. Edit the `config.toml` file to suit your requirements.

The `blogroot` setting points to the folder where your blog posts are. A paginated list of all posts in this folder will be shown on the homepage, underneath all content in the `_index.md` page. If you do not wish to display any posts on the homepage, simply comment the line, or delete it.

If you wish to add top level pages to your site (work/about/contact etc), place them in the root folder, and add the following to their front matter:

```toml
type: "singlepage"
layout: default
```

Hugo will then use the template in `layouts\singlepage\default.html` to process these pages. You can change the values for `type` and `layout`. Hugo looks for a template in `layouts\<type>\<layout>.html`.

## Todo:

- Netlify integration via a python script: this should be as simple as invoking the script, inputting your credentials, git repo and deploying
- Template variables in css, css optimization and simplification to allow easier customization
- CSS performance optimization
