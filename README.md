![Deploys by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/global/badges/netlify-light.svg "Deploys by Netlify")

A clean, minimal, netlify ready theme for Hugo, derived from hucore.

This is currently a work in progress. I've pushed it in order to be able to deploy to Netlify for live testing. Netlify integration is one of my main goals for this theme. The master branch is being continuously deployed [here](https://yoki-go.netlify.com/)

## Todo:

- CSS
- Organize theme structure
- Add filler content for preview
- Include script for netlify deployment
- Performance tweaks: remove above the fold scripts
